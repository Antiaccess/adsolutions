            <p>City Water Technology (CWT) is a water treatment consultancy, specialising in process engineering, which serves
              local councils and water authorities, and fills niche-gaps for larger consultancies. Their water-purifying
              projects are often small and well-defined, and fulfil a need for rare skills in the industry like manganese
              removal and multi-barrier filters.
              <br><br>CWT approached us with issues engaging new clients and re-engaging historic clients; they over-rely
              on the Managing Director’s 30 years of personal contacts and recent-to-current clients for business. They wanted
              help gaining exposure with potential clients and new market segments; educating ‘could-be’ clients about who
              they are and what they do.

          <p style="text-align:left">Michelle and I approached the problem holistically, by considering CWT’s tender bids, client engagement processes,
            CRM usage, business strategies and branding. Although we identified opportunities in those areas, for which we
            provided recommendations, we determined our efforts for the 2.5 week sprint would be best spent on a website
            redesign and content strategy.
            <br><br>Our modular and integrated web solution allows potential clients to quickly determine the competencies,
            key people and reference projects of CWT within the context of client needs.

            <p>We began with a review of CWT’s standing website to gain a deeper understanding of their offerings, business
              and history, as well as identify any immediately apparent design opportunities before the kick-off meeting.
              We discovered a website which wasn’t responsive, had a ‘T’-shaped site map, walls of text and an array of under
              construction service pages (which we later realised included core services). It was difficult, as laymen, to
              clearly determine what CWT do as their statements were broad and high-level, projects were hidden away and
              the services page did not have any hierarchy or context.<br><br><span style="font-weight: 600"> Suggestions:</span>
              <ul>
                <li> Make website design responsive for use across multiple devices and window sizes.</li>
                <li> Sort content into new Information Architecture, making structure more flat (less than three levels).</li>
                <li> Rewrite, reorganize and re-structure content for ease of consumption.</li>
                <li> Develop uniform content guidelines for use across website and transferral to other media.</li>
                <li> Generate a consistent visual design, including images, that aligns with CWT’s branding.</li>
                <li> Remove or create content for the array of service pages that are ‘Under Construction.’</li>
                <li> Upgrade case studies and capability statement’s to better reflect CWT’s long-standing reputation.</li>

                <li>There is little differentiation in regards to pages, content, layout & tone.</li>
                <li>The presentation of case studies is a key point-of-difference.</li>

            <p>To establish a design direction for the website, we used an impact-effort matrix to map our ideas in response
              to the insights we had synthesised thus far. We used the focus that this provided to sketch ideas and then
              create concept modules for a prioritisation session with our point-of-contact at CWT. We met Audrey for a coffee
              and asked her to move our modules around in the order of importance she saw as best fitting, then we asked
              for her to explain her rationale and took notes.</p>

            <p>With ranked features and validation that we were moving in the right direction from our key stakeholder, and
              having examined the current website content, we ran an open card internally to sort & organise modules into
              top-level site pages that made the most sense.

          <div class="eight columns">
            <p>Hereafter, we noticed an opportunity for dynamic & integrated content to repeat across modules on different pages;
              promoting the names and faces of staff, reference projects and key skills quickly and in an interconnected
              way. This strategy would be achieved and maintained through a Content Management System (CMS) whereby engineers,
              skills and case studies could be tagged and linked, then be woven throughout the site as support content. This
              would achieve an easy flow between related people, skills & projects, from which CWT could leverage interest
              with relevant calls-to-action.

                  set skill levels (competent / master) or determine if it’s a current strength or area you want to expand

            <p>This experience opened my eyes to the potential UX design has to make an impact at any level; the Managing Director
              told us mid-way through the second interview that it felt great to be thinking strategically again, and our
              point-of-contact left the handover presentation saying ‘Let’s do it,’ with a big smile on her face.  I also learned a lot about the water
              industry and was pleasantly surprised to work with such a transparent and progressive, family-run, company.

            <p>In addition to refining the above array of User Experience techniques, skills and thinking, I did take-away

            <ul>
              <li>Managing client expectations is very effective when done up front, and doing so is essential to getting client
                respect and trust for a successful project.</li>
              <li>The importance of respecting the point of contact by transmitting all communication through them.</li>
              <li>Doing certain work (such as client documentation) once in full detail, as opposed to drafting multiple times.</li>
              <li>Summarising interview notes in a digestible way makes for a great reference throughout the project.</li>
              <li>Work to your strengths and let your partner work to theirs: I found myself taking the lead in certain areas
                while Michelle took lead in others which taught me lots and only made us stronger as a team.</li>
              <li>The power of ‘yes-and’: building on ideas non-judgementally elevates them to new heights and promotes psychological
                safety.</li>
              <li>The effectiveness of productivity and organisation technology like Trello and Google Calendar.</li>
