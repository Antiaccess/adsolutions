                            <p>Ozharvest is the first perishable food rescue organisation in Australia; collecting excess quality

                                charities across the countries. They also host their own ‘take what you need, give what you
                                can’ supermarket. In this concept project, OzHarvest has decided to branch out from physical
                                food rescue and redistribution. Now, they want to utilise technology to educate people on
                                food waste, food security, good nutrition and sustainability, as well as motivate people
                                to take action.</p>

                            <p>With a 2-week sprint duration and such a massive goal, we immediately considered narrowing our
                                scope, but decided to explore our assumptions and do some general knowledge research up-front.
                                We then brainstormed an array of research methodologies that we thought could help us gain
                                clarity on some of these topics from a general audience; knowing that we would reverse-engineer
                                a product idea from how people relate to OzHarvest’s four pillars: food waste, food security,
                                nutrition & sustainability.</p>

                            increase community connectedness, improve self-worth and confidence,’ as well as getting volunteers
                            to engage with their charitable programmes. Existing education programmes exist in the form of
                            on-site workshops on nutrition, low-cost meals, budgeting, reading food labels, food storage
                            & shopping/cooking tips. Finally, they have an existing framework of advice, recipes, research
                            and statistics, centreing around food-waste, which provided a framework to build upon and to

                            cross-section of people up front. We performed surveys to uncover behaviours, and then later
                            interviews to drill down into motivations and beliefs. To get a broad cross-section of the population
                            we approached people on the street, guerilla-style, and to focus the questions we asked only
                            about their habits surrounding dinner. We wanted to learn people’s habits around shopping, consumption,
                            food waste and the factors dictating their purchases, including any environmental or ethical

                            by fuelling the knowledge and facilitating the goals of Idealists, we would cover the core functionality
                            for all three personas in the consumption space. From here, we could provide simpler, less feature
                            heavy pathways to meet the more basic needs of the other personas with a vision to converting
                            them into idealists later. We would do this by decreasing the difficulty of living their values,
                            giving them encouragement and placing delightful & incremental triggers throughout the process.

                        <p>We decided to create “happy-path” wire-flows and stories tied to the “Idealist” and “Fast-Laner”
                            personas to ensure they were able to only invest the time and energy that matches the value return
                            they desire from the app in the early stages of adoption. This meant that core features like
                            planning, recipe libraries, search & filtering, and shopping lists would be front-and-centre
                            while secondary features like causes, goal setting and impact visualization would be less visible
                            or at least optional.</p>

                        <p>I wasn’t aware of OzHarvest before being handed this fictional brief, but quickly began noticing
                            the presence of their van’s across Sydney’s CBD and appreciating their presence. This assignment
                            offered an opportunity to practice research skills, interview people in vox-pop style and work
                            together with a team from diverse backgrounds. I definitely believe the scope was insane for
                            a 2-week sprint, but it stretched us and forced us to come up with and execute on a plan which
                            was a valuable experience.</p>

                        <p>Beyond the core skills developed during the project, I appreciated learning about the utility of
                            sophisticated concept maps in context of designing a solution from Alastair. I also recognised
                            a deeper aptitude in myself than expected for elaborating on people’s ideas and facilitating
                            debates between team-members for mutually beneficial outcomes. Lastly, it was invaluable to learn
                            the importance of creating a roadmap upfront which constrains the scope to something feasible,
                            given the project length.</p>
