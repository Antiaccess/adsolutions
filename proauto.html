                            <p>Many motor dealerships are bogged down by processes that have not innovated over time, in many
                                cases they are mandated by their distributors into using systems that were built in the 90s
                                and are structurally unable to adapt quickly enough to meet their needs. I was asked to look
                                at one subsection of these processes for a group of automotive dealers, who are looking to
                                utilise digital products to enhance their workflows and make more money. The particular processes
                                they needed help with were leading to customers walking off the lot, rapport breaks between
                                salespeople and customers, money wasted on paper and ink, inaccurate or misplaced data and
                                wasted administrative time. For the duration of this case study, I will call this process:
                                ‘Task X’</p>

                            <p>I held 3 separate kickoff interviews with stakeholders to gain an understanding of the project,
                                their goals, key affected parties, the existing processes and to get ahold of reference material.
                                I then drafted a roadmap forward, starting with user interviews & contextual enquiries. As
                                this was a new product, I used the double-diamond to explain the UX process at a high-level
                                as well as some of the methodolgies I might utilise to get to an end result. Primarily, I
                                wanted the stakeholders to understand that insights from discovery could lead the solution
                                in unanticipated directions. They were incredibly open and encouraging of this.

                            <p>I conducted user interviews and observational research with four salespeople - preparing for the
                                interviews by drafting questions and assumptions. I learned about the context of ‘Task X’,
                                as well as some deep and enlightening insights into the goals and frustrations of sales staff,
                                as well as the needs of the customers that are in the showroom, shopping for their next vehicle.
                                For example, I learned that
                                <b>“90% of people buy for the emotional reason”</b> and that salespeople often <b>intentionally go
                                    off ‘Task X’ because it gives them a greater chance of making a sale</b>. These insights,
                                among others, drove major feature alterations on the final design.</p>

                            <p>I followed up each interview by asking the participant to carry out ‘Task X’ as they would normally
                                do, while narrating their thoughts and actions out loud. I just watched and listened. In
                                a notebook, I was attempting to piece together the actions required to successfully complete
                                the process and notice any points that contained friction. After observation I got the first
                                two participants to walk me through the process again, and I probed into their motivations
                                and received copies of all required documentation so I could re-create the process in a flowchart.</p>
                            <p>(If I had the chance to do this project again, I would have first hosted a journey mapping workshop
                                with all of the salespeople, to get an overview of: the actions required, the pains, the
                                goals and their ideas for solving any problems that came up. This would have been more efficient.)

                            <p>During the discussion on the competitive analysis findings with one of the stakeholders, we had
                                an epiphany that would elevate the solution’s commercial value well beyond ‘Task X.’ I followed
                                this revelation up with a business model canvas brainstorming session, where we fleshed out
                                the business solution as it began to transform to get clarity and ensure it was feasible.</p>

                            <p>Earlier, after mapping the process flowcharts, I created iPad-sized wireframes of the core process
                                and video recorded usability walkthroughs with salespeople on a Macbook. I asked the users
                                to undertake ‘Task X’ digitally without any prior introduction to the interface. I began
                                with many of the expected testing pleasantries: asking them to think out loud, assuring them
                                that I was testing the design and not them, and letting them know that there are no wrong
                                answers. The prototype was not hot-spotted, so when the users interacted with the screens
                                I would manually move them forward. I gained an array of insights which I turned into implications
                                and then iterations on the prototype. These changes ranged from moving less utilized features
                                from the main user-flow, to adding customization at the user-level, to changing back-end
                                processes.

                                user research, the project had begun to expand in scope. Due to the increasing scope, we
                                decided it made more sense for the solution to exist on mobile so it could be utilised by
                                non-salespeople who were increasingly gaining a role.</p>

                            <p>Following ideation, I mapped features on an impact-effort matrix to help determine what would
                                be included in the minimum viable product. This was run by stakeholders to get agreement,
                                and lead to the high-impact-low-effort features (and some of the high-impact-high-effort
                                features) being included as must-haves in our MoSCoW listing.</p>

                                a4 pages into 8 sections and then spent 15 minutes drawing up interface ideas for any part
                                of the app we wanted. We then shared these with each other and discussed why we had made

                                for the mobile version, so I dove right into a medium fidelity prototype in sketch. I determined
                                the information architecture, including where each feature would sit and how users could
                                navigate between them - this helped me design the navbar. Then I used a mix of known and
                                researched mobile patterns to guide my design of the core processes, looking at comparative
                                and popular apps for inspiration. This prototype formed the basis for many discussions and
                                went through some minor iterations before being presented to stakeholders.</p>

                                decided what methodologies would get me closer to a useful & usable product, and then implemented
                                them until I was confident I was solving real problems.
