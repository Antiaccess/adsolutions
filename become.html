                            <p>BEcoME. Education is on a mission to disrupt the cultural paradigm of late high-school students
                                being forced to make sudden career decisions which impact their short to long term futures,
                                without having the opportunity to explore who they are, what careers exist & suit them, and
                                whether considered options will have a real place in the future economy.

                                <br>They’re bringing design thinking into the classroom from primary school, so students are
                                encouraged to explore widely and self-generate experiments to validate or invalidate their
                                interest in a wide variety of potential futures.
                                <br>
                                <br>Their solution helps children generate a positive vision and goals for their futures, which
                                leads to an inbuilt mental framework of lifelong learning, resourcefulness and self-direction.</p>

                            <p>I met their technical co-founder, David Wilson, at a job fair and we connected over a discussion
                                of their mission and its potential impact. A month later, co-founder Liv Pennie reached out
                                to me to form part of the UX team.
                                <br>
                                <br>My role would centre around <b>generating high-level UI concepts</b> for their digital touch-points,
                                which fit inside a larger in-class workshop experience.
                                <br>
                                <br>I was thrilled to be considered for such a positive-impact project; having been a student
                                with little to no context around my future career until well after high-school, I was glad
                                to have the opportunity to contribute and help educate kids about a cornerstone of their
                                future lives.

                            <p>The kick-off meeting and brief indicated that BEcoME. had a well-researched programme to achieve
                                student outcomes, but they hadn’t yet brought their experience into a web user-interface.
                                <br>
                                <br> As such, they had the structure and wanted me to rapidly map two high-level UI concepts
                                onto it. This way, Liv and David could start building towards a release 4-6 months later.
                                <br>
                                <br>Effectively, they needed help bringing 3 core components into a ‘single-page-feel’ experience
                                that would
                                <b>make thinking about the future exciting & inspiring, motivate diverse students to actively
                                    participate, and provide students with a continual sense of progress to drive repeat

                            <p>I came up with a 3-phase roadmap which included discovery, ideation + validation, and convergence,
                                but it was out-of-sync with BEcoME.’s timelines (you can see my original statement of work
                                <a href="files/become-statementofwork.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).
                                <br>
                                <br>As such, my plan was reformulated to be more lean and to focus mostly on ideation based on
                                research that had already been conducted. Along with the UX lead, I set up workshops to interview
                                the stakeholders, determine personas and formulate user journeys, which would guide the design
                                process.</p>

                                and insights that they had accrued over time, from theory to pilot programme outcomes. It
                                was an opportunity for Alissa and I to ask our own questions, understand the business goals

                            <p>Alissa Condra, the UX lead on the project, planned two stakeholder workshops, which I assisted
                                in running with both founders. The first was a persona workshop. We started this session
                                with three high-level proto-personas provided by BEcoME which were representations of levels
                                of student investment in the process. We wanted to increase the resolution and make more
                                detailed distinctions between these personas to <b>gain empathy for the spectrum of students</b>.
                                <br><br>We asked the founders to list the characteristics, motivators, influences, frustrations and
                                fears of each type, and as they got more detailed, we were able to make clear splits in the
                                personas which morphed from 3 abstract personas into 9 personas with detailed attributes
                                based on stakeholder knowledge of users.</p>
                            <p>We came up with an array of experience considerations, needs and goals for four central personas,
                                to better meet the educational objectives the programme. These simple personas were tied
                                with images and descriptions so we could relate to each individual representation and design
                                for them.</p>

                            <p>The next session we ran was a journey mapping whiteboard session, which would act as an outline
                                of the entire functional and emotional experience from a persona’s point-of-view. Alissa
                                did the heavy lifting in running the session, and I provided assistance and prompts to keep
                                the conversation going and on track. We identified key moments, thoughts/feelings and opportunities
                                to support persona needs through each of their slightly differing journeys.

                            <p>The big challenge for me, was that there was so little time to do any independent primary research
                                or test/validate ideas & assumptions that were formed over the duration of the project. <br><br>If
                                I could have changed one thing, it would have been that we could have supplemented the project
                                with user-testing with students, even if only for a day or two. <br><br>Additionally, I believe it
                                would have been wise to conduct some feature prioritization sessions to narrow and constrain
                                our focus; this wasn’t possible at the time, which meant I was forced to handover a wide
                                array of ideas that the rest of the team could consider, incorporate and test when determining a minimum
                                viable product.

                            <p>The founders of this project were incredibly passionate, knowledgeable and thorough in their
                                understanding of education on careers. It was a real pleasure to be involved with self-starting
                                entrepreneurs who are creating a product with human and market value, and it struck both
                                a personal chord and related deeply to my belief in applied design thinking. <br><br>I was inspired
                                by their business acumen and pursuit of a meaningful solution to a widespread social issue.</p>
