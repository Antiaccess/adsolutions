                            <p>BEcoME. Education is on a mission to disrupt the cultural paradigm of late high-school students
                                being forced to make sudden career decisions which impact their short to long term futures,
                                without having the opportunity to explore who they are, what careers exist & suit them, and
                                whether considered options will have a real place in the future economy. They’re bringing
                                design thinking into the classroom from late primary school, so students are encouraged to
                                explore widely and self-generate experiments to validate or invalidate their interest in
                                a wide variety of potential futures. The desired outcome is to create a generation with an
                                inbuilt mental framework of lifelong learning, resourcefulness and self-direction.</p>

                            <p>I met their technical co-founder, David Wilson, at a job fair and we connected over a discussion
                                of their mission and its potential impact. A month later, co-founder Liv Pennie reached out
                                to me for help generating high-level UX concepts for their digital touch-points (which fit
                                inside a larger in-class workshop experience). I was thrilled to be considered for such a
                                positive-impact project; having been a student with little to no context about my future
                                until well after high-school, I was glad to have the opportunity to contribute and help educate
                                kids about a cornerstone of their future lives.</p>

                            <p>The kick-off meeting and brief indicated that BEcoME. had a well-researched programme to achieve
                                student outcomes, but they hadn’t yet brought their experience into a web user-interface.
                                As such, they had the structure and wanted me to rapidly map two high-level UI concepts onto
                                it. This way, Liv and David could start building towards a release 4-6 months later. Effectively,
                                they needed help bringing 3 core components into a ‘single-page-feel’ experience that would
                                make thinking about the future exciting & inspiring, motivate diverse students to actively
                                participate, and provide students with a continual sense of progress to drive repeat engagement.</p>

                            <p>I came up with a 3-phase roadmap which included discovery, ideation + validation, and convergence,
                                but it was out-of-sync with BEcoME.’s timelines and too costly (you can see my original statement
                                of work
                                <a href="files/become-statementofwork.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). As such, my plan was reformulated to be more lean and to focus mostly on ideation
                                based on research that had already been conducted. Another UX designer was brought in to
                                lead the project, and we set up workshops to interview the stakeholders, determine personas
                                and formulate user journeys, which would guide the design process.</p>

                            <p>BEcoME. Kicked the project off with an information session where they passed on the central research
                                and insights that they had accrued over time, from theory to pilot programme outcomes. It
                                was an opportunity for Alissa and I to ask our own questions, understand the business goals
                                and dig deeper into the insights they were sharing on their users. I paired this with some
                                theoretical reading on the stages of human development and BEcoME.’s workshop documentation
                                to define some implications for the user-interface and to prompt further discussion. I was

                            <p>Alissa Condra, the new UX lead on the project, planned two stakeholder workshops, which I assisted
                                in running with both founders. The first was a persona workshop. We started this session
                                with three high-level proto-personas provided by BEcoME.: horizon gazers, heads up students
                                & heads down students - three representations of levels of student investment in the process.
                                We wanted to increase the resolution and make more detailed distinctions between these personas
                                to gain empathy for the spectrum of students. We asked the founders to list the characteristics,
                                motivators, influences, frustrations and fears of each type, and as they got more detailed,
                                we were able to make clear splits in the personas which morphed from 3 abstract personas
                                into 9 personas with detailed attributes based on stakeholder knowledge of users.</p>

                            <p>We came up with an array of experience considerations, needs and goals for four central personas,
                                to better meet the educational objectives the programme. These simple personas were tied
                                with images and descriptions so we could relate to each individual representation and design
                                for them.</p>

                                of the entire functional and emotional experience from a persona’s point-of-view. Alissa
                                did the heavy lifting in running the session, and I provided assistance and prompts to keep
                                the conversation going and on track. We identified key moments, thoughts/feelings and opportunities
                                to support persona needs through each of their slightly differing journeys.

                                and higher-level experience. We met up for several sessions to share our work and incorporate
                                one another’s models into a uniform experience, which turned out to be a very productive
                                strategy given our differing roles. I could focus on detailing features and Alissa could
                                focus on making sure there was holistic coherence; but in reality we crossed into one another’s

                                with user-testing with students, even if only for a day or two. Additionally, I believe it
                                would have been wise to conduct some feature prioritization sessions to narrow and constrain
                                our focus; this wasn’t possible at the time, which meant I was forced to handover a wide
