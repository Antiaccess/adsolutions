                            <p>Gaining new leads within the competitive water treatment consulting industry.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p> City Water technology (CWT), a family-run water treatment consultancy, came to us with the belief
                                that UX could help them find and retain business leads. The managing director, Bruce Murray,
                                had been responsible for building ongoing client relationships from before the digital era,
                                but with plans to take a step back into semi-retirement, this strategy was no longer tenable.
                                At the same time, CWT was losing out to tender bids from bigger companies and not getting
                                enough reference work in certain geographical locations to gain inter-state credibility.
                                I connected with the team’s family-charm that was clearly a big factor in their success,
                                and was excited to discover what drives the industry how learning more might uncover a new
                                business strategy. </p>

                            <p>We knew that CWT’s lead-generating challenge could be a symptom with an array of causes, so our
                                kick-off meeting focused on questioning an array of business practices before we considered
                                the impact of addressing their website. We asked Bruce and Audrey, about their client engagement
                                processes, tender bids, business strategies and CRM usage. Although there were clearly some
                                areas for improvement, it appeared that they had only considered their online presence to
                                the extent of assigning it to staff-member to do in their spare time, and as such were missing
                                any real digital strategy.

                            <p>We generated a roadmap to cover the two-and-a-half weeks which focused on discovery. We would

                                as competitive analysis, insights, personas and demographics, but wanted to leave the small
                                company with something they could take away and implement for the sake of quick-wins.

                            <p>Doing an evaluation of their home-grown website was our starting point; we wanted to see what
                                story their website told without pre-conceptions. We logged a website with a T-shaped information
                                architecture whereby the primary information was hidden 3 levels deep. There was extensive
                                usage of industry jargon, an absence of calls-to-action and it was hard for both of us, as
                                laymen, to determine their story or value proposition. Interestingly, their services contained
                                an array of under construction pages and was 36 items long despite their tagline: ‘water
                                treatment specialists.’ We made some suggestions and set them aside for later:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make the CWT home-page clearly state what the company offers and answer users key questions
                                    so they aren’t frustrated and leave immediately</li>
                                <li>Re-consider which services CWT should prioritize in line with their competencies and business
                                    goals
                                </li>
                                <li>Upgrade case studies in a digestible & modern format to better reflect CWT’s long-standing
                                    reputation.
                                </li>

                                for key players in the surrounding market. There were a few core pages that CWT had not addressed
                                which were present in all of their competitors websites, including case studies and news/blogs.
                                The presentation of past projects was also a major point-of-difference, something that their
                                primary competitor did very well. Lastly, we learned that a few competitors had client portals
                                to manage projects and keep businesses updated on their work.</p>

                            <p>This project was a great foray into UX client work; I felt we really added value, to an area
                                CWT was a bit lost in, and were able to identify some digital pathways that could affect
                                their bottom line. The managing director, Bruce Murray, closed our stakeholder interview
                                by saying how refreshing it felt to be thinking strategically again, and at the end of the
                                handover presentation our point of contact, Audrey Knickerbocker, thanked us and said ‘let’s
                                do it.’ Both were willing to continue working with Michelle and I, but other commitments
                                prevented that occurring. This feedback was really motivating for me and reminded me that
                                the focus for my career is likely going to be on innovation areas in an agency setting or
                                as a freelancer, where I can make a relatively big impact in a short time.</p>

                            <p>I also took away a few key lessons that I will carry forward. We benefitted from setting client
                                expectations up front, doing documentation alongside our work and working to each other’s
                                strengths. Michelle taught me a lot about client relationship management & building a presentation
                                deck, and I lead some of the investigative questioning. Both of us were aligned on our interpretation
                                of the research and bounced really well off each other throughout the ideation & design phases.
                                It was genuinely fun & intellectually stimulating working with her.</p>
