            <p>OzHarvest is the first perishable food rescue organisation in Australia; collecting excess quality food from
              donors and delivering it, direct and free of charge, to more than one thousand charities across the country
              as well as hosting their own <span style="font-style:italic">‘take what you need, give what you can’</span>              supermarket.
              <br><br>Now, OzHarvest wants to branch out from food rescue and leverage technology to educate people from
              all walks of life on nutrition, food waste, food security and sustainability, then move them to action!

            OzHarvest’s Four Pillars: food waste, nutrition, food security & sustainability. <br><br>This lead us to develop

            <p>An analysis of OzHarvest’s web content exposed a broader framework within which our solution would have to fit.
              We discovered their mission statement for education is <span style="font-style: italic">‘to increase community connectedness, improve self-worth
                and confidence,’</span> as well as getting volunteers to engage with their charitable programmes. Existing
              education programmes exist in the form of on-site workshops on nutrition, low-cost meals, budgeting, reading
              food labels, food storage & shopping/cooking tips. Finally, they have an existing framework of advice, recipes,
              research and statistics, centreing around food-waste, which provided a framework to validate our ideas against
              throughout our design process.

                  & paths to a goal, and statistics.</li>

            <p>Ozharvest’s ambitious concern of significantly lessening world hunger factors in the entirety of the population,
              so it was key to research a vast cross-section of people up front. We hypothesised that uncovering behaviours
              and actions with a survey would provide a platform from which to dig into motivations and beliefs with face-to-face
              interviews (which we conducted guerrilla style; approaching strangers of the public).<br><br>Due to the sprint
              duration, we narrowed our questions to most people’s main meal: dinner. We wanted to learn people’s habits
              around shopping, consumption, food waste and the factors dictating their purchases, including any environmental
              or ethical considerations. We grouped this qualitative data into insights, using over 200 post-its (or one
              tree).

            <p>BJ Fogg’s behaviour model indicates that three elements must align at the same moment for a behaviour to occur:
              a value (Motivation), the accessibility of outcome (Ability) and a call to action (Trigger).<br><br> With a
              clear overlap between our findings, the Fogg behaviour model and the goal of the brief, we decided to create
              three separate hypotheses which each reflect a single element of the equation and enable ideation which intrinsically

              core functionality for all three personas in the consumption space. From here, we could provide simpler, less
              feature heavy pathways to meet the more basic needs of the other personas with a vision to converting them
              into idealists later. We would do this by decreasing the difficulty of living their values, giving them encouragement

              to our hypotheses and mapped them together on an impact-effort matrix to help constrain ourselves. We gave
              more weight to ideas which supported behaviour change through improving user ability primarily, followed by
              those which increased motivation or triggers from the BJ Fogg Model.

              – in the high impact quadrants. Although these became the focus for our proposal of Minimum Viable Product
              (MVP), we decided to leave doors open for food security and advanced nutrition in our ideation for future scalability.

            <p>OzHarvest’s goal of educating and moving people to action regarding food waste, sustainability, security and
              nutrition, lead us to research and discover an array of anchors holding people back from living such values.
              We learned that people want to achieve better outcomes across these pillars, but need help taking action, discerning
              useful information and getting reliable positive reinforcement. As such, we designed a concept for a meal-planning
              app which facilitates the shopping process from deciding what to eat to shopping in-store to cooking. It goes
              beyond other goal-setting and meal-planning apps in the marketplace by being a single-source stop for education,
              scheduling, impact insights and goal tracking.

            <h4 class="topicHead">Wireframe Flows</h4>
            <p>We decided to create “happy-path” wire-flows and stories tied to the “Idealist” and “Fast-Laner” personas to
              ensure they were able to only invest the time and energy that matches the value return they desire from the
              app in the early stages of adoption. This meant that core features like planning, recipe libraries, search
              & filtering, and shopping lists would be front-and-centre while secondary features like causes, goal setting
              and impact visualization would be less visible or at least optional. <span style="font-style:italic">(if below image doesn't display correctly,

              partnership with Woolworths, we took some primary functionality from the app and designed a digital kiosk which
              users could quickly use to pick a few recipe’s and generate a printed shopping list with in-store products.

            <p>I wasn’t aware of OzHarvest before being handed this fictional brief, but quickly began noticing the presence
              of their van’s across Sydney’s CBD and appreciating their presence. This assignment offered an opportunity
              to practice research skills, interview people in vox-pop style and work together with a team from diverse backgrounds.
              Beyond the core skills developed during the project, I appreciated learning about the utility of sophisticated
              concept maps in context of designing a solution from Alastair. I also recognised a deeper aptitude in myself
              than expected for elaborating on people’s ideas and facilitating debates between team-members for mutually
              beneficial outcomes. Lastly, it was invaluable to learn the importance of creating a roadmap upfront which
              constrains the scope to something feasible, given the project length.
